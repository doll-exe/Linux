# Recommended read when transitioining from level 8 to level 9
Every program we run on the command line automatically has three data streams connected to it:

1. STDIN (0) - Standard input (data fed into the program)
2. STDOUT (1) - Standard output (data printed by the program, defaults to the terminal)
3. STDERR (2) - Standard error (for error messages, also defaults to the terminal)
