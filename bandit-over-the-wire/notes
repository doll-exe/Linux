USEFUL COMMANDS I FOUND WHILE SOLVING:
LEVEL 4:
find . -type f -exec file {} \;

find [starting_directory] [options] [expression]
[starting_directory]:
/ for root directory
. for current directory
~ home directory
or a specific path

[options]:
-type type_char (filters results by file type):
-- f regular file
-- d directory
-- l symbolic link

[expression]:
-exec command(file) {} \; (or instead of '\;' '+')
Executes a specified command on each found file 

LEVEL 5:
find . -type f -size 1033c -exec file {} \; -exec ls -l {} \;
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
NOTE: -rw-r----- â†’ r = read, w = write, no x = not executable.
If it had x (like -rwxr-xr-x), then it would be executable.
PASSWORD FOR LEVEL 6: HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
