*USEFUL COMMANDS I FOUND WHILE SOLVING:*

LEVEL 4:
find . -type f -exec file {} \;

find [starting_directory] [options] [expression]
[starting_directory]:
/ for root directory
. for current directory
~ home directory
or a specific path

[options]:
-type type_char (filters results by file type):
-- f regular file
-- d directory
-- l symbolic link

[expression]:
-exec command(file) {} \; (or instead of '\;' '+')
Executes a specified command on each found file 


LEVEL 5:
find . -type f -size 1033c -exec file {} \; -exec ls -l {} \;
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
NOTE: -rw-r----- â†’ r = read, w = write, no x = not executable.
If it had x (like -rwxr-xr-x), then it would be executable.

#CONNECTION ISSUE RESOLVED
I tried to connect SSH but my VM was resisting to connect... Then I checked my VMs connection settings and NAT connection was established.

!A NAT (Network Address Translation) connection is a network setup where a router translates the private IP addresses of devices on a local network 
into a single public IP address to access the internet, and vice-versa. This technique conserves IP addresses, as a whole network of devices shares 
one public IP. It also provides security by hiding the internal network from the public internet.!

I changed it to bridged connection which connects my VM directly to the network. It worked and everything was fixed, I was able to ping 8.8.8.8 and ping google.com, 
however as I know, bridged connection is less secure than NAT connection and even though bandit game is not dangerous in any way, i still was eager to fix it.

I pressed WIN + R and typed 'services.msc', found VMware NAT service and VMware DHCP service and restarted both, restarted my VM and everything started working. 
I fixed VMware NAT on my host computer.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a standard network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other configuration information, 
such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers, to devices (hosts) on a network.


LEVEL 6:
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/*Here 2>/dev/null is used to hide all files that say "Permission denied"
