1) TERMINAL GOT STUCK
I finished setting up my new virtual machine (Ubuntu) and when i did:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

it updated my ubuntu, but my terminal seemed to be stuck, so i did:
pkill -9 gnome-terminal

2) CANT COPYPASTE FROM TERMINAL TO HOST AND VISE VERSA
i set up a new Ubuntu VM but i couldn't copypaste from VM to host machine and vise versa.
i checked the VM options and the clipboard was connected and shared. my VM was missing
open-vm-tools...
to check if i had it:

dpkg -l | grep open-vm-tools

- dpkg is a tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian packages
- -l is for listing
- | is piping

i didn't have it so:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop -y
sudo reboot
